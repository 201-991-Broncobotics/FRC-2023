It uses [base falcon swerve](https://github.com/Team364/BaseFalconSwerve) made by Team 364, as well as [pathplanner](https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner) for planning out our autonomous routines.

Also check out our [Auto Selector and arm simulation](https://github.com/skeole/991-DoubleArm-Simulation), which our drivers use for better control of the driver.
